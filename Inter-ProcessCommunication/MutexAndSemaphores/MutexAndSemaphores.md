# Mutex and Semaphores  

## Semaphore  

- A **semaphore** is somewhat like an integer variable, but is special in that its operations
(increment and decrement) are guaranteed to be **atomic**â€”you cannot be halfway
through incrementing the semaphore and be interrupted and waylaid by another thread
trying to do the same thing.
- By convention, when a semaphore is zero it is "locked" or "in use". 
- Positive values indicate that the
semaphore is available. 
- A semaphore will never have a negative value.
- Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count are called **counting semaphores**, while semaphores which are restricted to the values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are called **binary semaphores** and are used to implement locks.
- Semaphores provide two operations: **wait (P)** and **signal (V)**. The wait operation decrements the value of the semaphore, and the signal operation increments the value of the semaphore.
- When the value of the semaphore is zero, any process that performs a wait operation will be blocked until another process performs a signal operation.  
- Operations for accessing and changing value of semaphore variable.

```pseudocode
P(semaphore s) {
    // wait - P
    while (s==0); // wait until s=0.
    s = s-1;
}

V(semaphore s) {
    // signal - V
    s = s+1;
}
```
- P operation is called the wait, sleep or down operation.
- V operation is called signal, wake-up or up operation.
- Both operations are atomic and semaphore(s) is always initialized to 1.
- Both of the above operaitons are atomic. 
- In atomic operations, in-between read, modify and update no other operation is performed that may change the variable.
- A critical section is surrounded by both operations to implement process synchronization.

```
// Some code
P(s);
// critical section 
V(s);
// remainder section
```

### POSIX Semaphores
#### Manpage

```bash
man sem_overview
```
POSIX semaphores allow processes and threads to synchronize their
actions.

Two operations can be performed on semaphores:
- increment the semaphore value by one (sem_post(3)) and 
- decrement the semaphore value by one (sem_wait(3)).  

If the value of a semaphore is currently zero, then a sem_wait(3) operation will block until the value becomes greater than zero.

POSIX semaphores come in two forms: named semaphores and unnamed
semaphores.


## Mutex  

- Stands for MUTual EXclusion.
- It is basically an integer value in global memory.
- They are implemented using atomic operations.
- Atomic operations are instructions within the processor that are impossible to interrupt. No one is able to access the memory targeted by the instruction until the instruction completes execution.



### POSIX Mutexes
#### Manpage
```bash
sudo apt install glibc-doc
man pthread_mutex_lock
```

pthread_mutex_lock(), pthread_mutex_unlock(), pthread_mutex_init(), pthread_mutex_destroy() are basic funcitons used for POSIX implementation of mutex.


## Semaphores vs. Mutexes

- A mutex is a locking mechanism that sometimes uses the same basic implementation as the binary semaphore. 
- The differences between them are in how they are used. 
- While a binary semaphore may be colloquially referred to as a mutex, a true mutex has a more specific use-case and definition, in that only the task that locked the mutex is supposed to unlock it.
- Mutexes have a concept of ownership the thread that locks it is supposed to unlock it. 
- Mutex is SUPPOSED TO be unlocked by the thread/process that has locked it. If another thread/process unlcks it, it results in undefined behaviour and can cause the program to break unexpectedly.  
(see program 6-bin_sem_vs_mutex.c)
- This constraint aims to handle some potential problems of using semaphores:

1. Priority inversion: If the mutex knows who locked it and is supposed to unlock it, it is possible to promote the priority of that task whenever a higher-priority task starts waiting on the mutex.
2. Premature task termination: Mutexes may also provide deletion safety, where the task holding the mutex cannot be accidentally deleted.
3. Termination deadlock: If a mutex-holding task terminates for any reason, the OS can release the mutex and signal waiting tasks of this condition.
4. Recursion deadlock: a task is allowed to lock a reentrant mutex multiple times as it unlocks it an equal number of times.
5. Accidental release: An error is raised on the release of the mutex if the releasing task is not its owner.
